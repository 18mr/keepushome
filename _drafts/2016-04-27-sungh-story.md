My name is Sung Hester. When I was six years old, I was brought to the U.S by my grandmother. I was later adopted by my aunt and her army husband at the age of 10 due to the hardships I endured from being orphaned and abused. However, they never filed the adoption with immigration to ensure I had permanent legal resident status or citizenship. They just thought after the legal adoption, I became a U.S citizen.
  
It wasn't until I was released from a Federal prison after 11 years when I tried to obtain my social security card that I was told that I did not have citizenship. I have lived in the U.S since I was six years old. I was told everyday that I was a U.S citizen. It was a heartbreaking realization and I am now living in fear of being separated from my wife and family.
 
I've made mistakes and served time, but I've changed my way of thinking. All I want is to do right and live my life in the only place I've known and believed to be home. Being deported is another sentence far worse than the term I spent in penitentiary. I am lost and even if the Childhood Citizenship Act amendment passed, it served me - and all other adoptees who entered legally but never obtained permanent resident status - no justice.
  
So far, it will take the act and will of God for me to be saved. I can't seem to find any avenues or bills that push lawmakers to consider giving people like me another chance.
