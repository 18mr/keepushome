My name is Adam Crapser. I’m a Korean adoptee and father of 3, with 1 on the way in May. I'm currently fighting a life-changing deportation proceedings due to the negligence of my adoptive parents, who did not naturalize me as a kid. I have faced horrific abuse, relinquished twice by two sets of adoptive parents, was torn from my biological sister while in the States, but through all this, as a survivor and father, I’m determined to ensure that my wife and children are provided with a life of love and happiness.
