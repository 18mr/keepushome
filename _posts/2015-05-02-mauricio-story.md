My name is Mauricio Cappelli. I was born in San Jose, Costa Rica in 1979. I was brought to Milwaukee, WI in 1981 with my mother. My mother married a U.S. citizen in 1982. A couple months later, I received my legal permanent resident status and was adopted by my father. The adoption started in 1982 and was completed four years later in 1986. My parents had two more children and are still married. I was told I was a U.S citizen my whole life. 

At the age of 35, I left on a ten day vacation and upon my return I was detained and deported in August 2015. I was left in the airport with nothing, but a clear garbage bag of jail things in a country I have never lived in. I do not speak Spanish and it is hard for me to live here. I have been here 8 months and have not been able to find employment. I  sleep wherever I can find shelter. There are no addresses here and I don’t have transportation. I had a bike which was stolen.  I'm living off of money my family sends me. 

Now I’m waiting for the Childhood Citizenship Act to pass so I can come home.
