My name is Judy CV.  Although my natural father was a U.S. soldier, from whom I inherited curly-haired gene, I have never met him. After being adopted at age 12 by American missionaries in Taiwan, I arrived to the U.S. four years later upon completion of their missionary service.  

Unfortunately it was not an adoption made in heaven, my adoptive mother became jealous that my adoptive father was teaching English to me.  Few weeks into my adoption, mistaking me as the “other woman,” she asked me to go into the bathroom with her one day.  After locking the bathroom door, she accused me of stealing her husband, slapped my face and started attacking me with a wooden stick.  The times I was safe from her abuses were when my father was home, their adult children came from U.S. to visit, or we had other visitors.

My adoptive mother mostly ignored me when my adoptive father was home.  Her abuses would begin after he left for surgery work in Taiwan Seventh Day Adventist hospital.  We lived in a compound with 4 homes, adjacent to the hospital, built for medical missionaries.  The bathroom was her favorite torture chamber - neighbors could not hear my cries.

After living in the U.S. for almost two years, to free myself from my adoptive mother's torture, I tried joining the military at age 17.  But my father refused to sign the requisite paperwork and dissuaded me from enlisting.

When my home was foreclosed in 1999, I lost my social security and green cards and landed in a catch-22 impasse.  Due to shoplifting convictions, I am fearful of contacting ICE for a replacement green card.  Social security Administration requires viewing a green card prior to issuing a replacement social security card.

Although I have a bachelor's degree in nursing, without citizenship and the proper documents to legally work has been a living hell.
