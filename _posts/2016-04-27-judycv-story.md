My name is Judy CV. Although my natural father was a U.S. soldier, I have never met him. After being adopted at age 12 by American missionaries in Taiwan, I returned to U.S. four years later upon completion of their missionary service. 

Unfortunately it was not an adoption made in heaven. Three months into my adoption, my adoptive mother became jealous that my adoptive father was teaching me English.  Mistaking me as the “other woman,” she accused me of stealing her husband.  When my father was home she mostly ignored me, but after he left for work in Taiwan Seventh Day Adventist hospital, she physically and mentally abused me.

To free myself from my adoptive mother's torture, I tried to join the military at age 17. But my father refused to sign the requisite paperwork and dissuaded me from enlisting.

When my home was foreclosed in 1999, I lost my social security and green cards and landed in a catch-22 impasse. Due to shoplifting convictions, I am fearful of contacting ICE for a replacement green card.  Social security Administration requires viewing a green card prior to issuing a replacement social security card.

Although I have a Bachelor degree in nursing, without citizenship and the proper documents to legally work has been a living hell.   

Please pass the Adoptee Citizenship Act, a lifeline bestowing all adoptees equal opportunities and livelihood.
