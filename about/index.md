##What's the Law?

It used to be that if you were adopted from another country into an American family, your family had to complete paperwork to apply for your naturalization. Though many adoptive parents filed their adopted child's paperwork, some parents either didn't know they had to, or didn't want to, do this for their child. These kids ended up coming of age without citizenship, in spite of being raised in U.S. citizen families.

In 2000, Congress passed the Child Citizenship Act, which dealt with this loophole facing international adoptees in the United States. Unfortunately, it created a new one: while it granted citizenship to children adopted into U.S. families age 18 and under, those who had aged out--who were older than 18 years of age in 2000--were excluded from the Act. Those adoptees--thousands, from countries around the world--were left high and dry.

__Stateless adoptees can't get driver licenses or passports. They can't open a bank account. They can't get a job. And, if they run into trouble with the law, they're at risk of deportation to the countries they were adopted from, often at very young ages.__

We're working to pass the Adoptee Citizenship Act (S2275) to include those left out in the original law, so adoptees like [Adam Crapser](http://keepushome.org/adams-story/) don't have to live in the shadows anymore. The bill is being sponsored by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Dan Coats (R-IN).

Now is the time to take action, for Adam and other adoptees without citizenship. Contact your lawmakers to encourage them to keep Adam home with his family and to finally fix the Child Citizenship Act of 2000. Tell them to #KeepUsHome: so adoptees whoâ€™ve been deported can come back to the US, and all international adoptees can hold in their hands what was promised to them as children: their citizenship.
