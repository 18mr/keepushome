## You're Being Connected!

You'll receive a call from us shortly with further instructions.

__Here are some talking points to help you with your call.__

<div class="featurebox">
	<ul class="script">
		<li><strong>If you or someone you love will directly benefit from amending the Child Citizenship Act, be sure to say so!</strong></li>
		<li>Amending the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 is fundamentally about supporting adoption, a legal family-building process protected by law.</li>
		<li>Granting citizenship to adoptees is at the very heart of adoption – the promise of a better life with a family in a country where adoptees are also granted all the protections and privileges of citizenship.</li>
		<li>If one isn’t supportive of the amendment and granting citizenship to adoptees, you’re questioning the very foundations of adoption.</li>
		<li>Many adoptees are living in the shadow of possible deportation. Is this what we as a country do to people who were brought over as children by adults who ultimately failed them?</li>
		<li>The system is failing kids like Adam Crapser who were brought here under legal contract, and we could potentially damage these people even more.</li>
		<li>We need help from every Member of Congress to protect Adam and adoptees who could face deportation because of no fault of their own.</li>
		<li>This is a chance for the Senator/Representative to be a champion for adoptees.</li>
		<li>I’m calling to ask the Senator/Representative to vote to pass the amendment to the Child Citizenship Act.</li>
